        Strained yogurt, Greek or Greek-style yogurt, yogurt cheese, sack yogurt, 
        kerned yogurt or labneh is yogurt that has been strained to remove most of its whey, 
        resulting in a thicker consistency than normal unstrained yogurt,
         while still preserving the distinctive sour taste of yogurt
         <br />
